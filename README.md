# CLIMATE-CHANGE-DIPLOMACY

Although India appears to be taking a defensive position in relation to climate change in the international arena, there have been a large number of measures that have been initiated since 1990 within India and these measures collectively are likely to lead to a decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions from energy development and possibly even economic growth.
India's success in renewable energy auctions, in reducing emissions besides its largest commitment to eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022, has enabled it to win accolades globally. Even the Indian private sector is not lagging behind in joining the ranks of leading global companies that have committed to set a scientific target to be carbon negative.
